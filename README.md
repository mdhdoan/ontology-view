🧬 Ontology Viewer & Graph Explorer (Streamlit)

An interactive Streamlit-based ontology workbench for exploring OWL/RDF/Turtle ontologies through:

Class and property browsing

Interactive hierarchy and property-centric graphs

Live SPARQL querying

JSON export of graph neighbourhoods

GitHub-hosted ontologies or uploaded local files

This tool was designed to support deep ontology inspection, testing, and collaboration workflows.

✨ Key Features
✅ Ontology Sources

GitHub mode
Load live ontologies directly from a GitHub repository (e.g. /ontology/*.ttl)

Upload mode
Upload and explore:

.ttl (Turtle)

.owl, .rdf, .xml (RDF/XML)

✅ Class Explorer

Full searchable table of:

Class label

IRI

Parent class (rdfs:subClassOf)

Description (rdfs:comment)

Live filtering by label or IRI

Designed for fast ontology auditing

✅ Property Explorer (Robust)

Detects:

owl:ObjectProperty

owl:DatatypeProperty

owl:AnnotationProperty

rdf:Property

Untyped properties inferred via rdfs:domain / rdfs:range

Includes:

Property label

IRI

Kind (Object / Datatype / Annotation / Generic / Unknown)

Domain

Range

Description

Filter by property type and text search

✅ Interactive Graph Views
1) Class Hierarchy Graph

Visualizes:

Focus class

Ancestors (parents)

Descendants (children)

Colored roles:

🟡 Focus

🔵 Ancestors

🟢 Descendants

⚪ Others

Right-side details panel shows:

Label, IRI, role

Definition

Types

Parents & children

Properties using the class as domain/range

2) Property-Centric Graph

Visualizes:

Property node (🟧)

Domain classes (🟪)

Range classes (🟦)

Right-side property details:

Kind

Domain

Range

Description

✅ Graph Export

Download the current graph neighbourhood as JSON

Works for:

Class hierarchy graphs

Property-centric graphs

Useful for:

Neo4j import

D3 / front-end visualization

Documentation snapshots

✅ SPARQL Playground

Run arbitrary SPARQL queries against the loaded ontology

Built-in presets, including:

List all classes

List all properties with domain/range

All subclasses of EscapementMethod

MU → CU → Stock chains (DFO model)

Outputs live, sortable result tables

🛠️ Installation
1. Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows

2. Install dependencies
pip install streamlit rdflib requests pandas networkx pyvis

▶️ Running the App
Local Machine
streamlit run app.py

Remote Machine / VPN
streamlit run app.py --server.address 0.0.0.0 --server.port 8502


Then access from your browser:

http://<REMOTE-IP>:8502


If the server uses ufw:

sudo ufw allow 8502

🔄 Ontology Source Modes
✅ GitHub Mode

Loads .ttl files from:

/ontology/*.ttl


on a live GitHub repo.

Supports:

Branch switching

Cache refresh

Automatically reflects upstream ontology updates.

✅ Upload Mode

Upload:

.ttl → Turtle

.owl, .rdf, .xml → RDF/XML

Optional manual format override.

Entire app switches instantly to the uploaded ontology.

🧭 Using the Graph Views
Class Hierarchy Mode

Select a class.

Adjust depth slider.

View ancestors & descendants.

Inspect any node in the right-hand details panel.

Download the neighbourhood as JSON.

Property-Centric Mode

Select a property.

View:

Domain classes

Range classes

Inspect property definition.

Download the property graph as JSON.

📤 Exporting Graph Data

Each graph mode includes:

Download neighbourhood as JSON


Result format:

{
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "...", "label": "...", "role": "..."}
  ],
  "edges": [
    {"source": "...", "target": "...", "relation": "..."}
  ]
}


Compatible with:

Neo4j loaders

D3.js

Cytoscape

Custom front-end tools

🔎 Using This With Other Ontologies

This tool works with any OWL/RDF ontology, not just one project.

✅ Supported Formats

Turtle (.ttl)

RDF/XML (.owl, .rdf, .xml)

✅ Works Best When Ontology Has:

rdfs:label for human-friendly class/property names

rdfs:comment for definitions

rdfs:subClassOf for hierarchy

rdfs:domain / rdfs:range for properties

⚠️ Notes on Imports

Imported ontologies (owl:imports) are not automatically fetched

If your ontology references:

SKOS

RO

PROV

SOSA/SSN
you may only see locally defined terms unless those imports are merged into your file.

✅ Best Practices for External Projects

If you plan to use this with other ontologies:

✅ Prefer a single merged TTL when possible

✅ Ensure properties have domain/range

✅ Declare property types (owl:ObjectProperty, etc.)

✅ Add labels for all public classes and properties

🧪 Example Use Cases

Ontology QA/QC

Schema refactoring

Cross-standard alignment reviews

Teaching ontology structure

Neo4j/KG import validation

DFO / PSC / research model exploration

🚀 Roadmap Ideas (Optional)

Click-to-select nodes directly from the graph

TTL / JSON-LD neighbourhood export

Ontology diff between GitHub branches

Class-to-property combined graphs

Automated documentation generation
